# 🏦 Bank Marketing Effectiveness Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on historical bank marketing campaign data. It includes complete ML pipeline development: data preprocessing, EDA, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment via Streamlit.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Class Imbalance: ~88% of clients did not subscribe
- Subscription likelihood increases with:
  - Longer call duration
  - Higher balance
  - Past campaign success
- Students and retirees showed higher conversion rates

---

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

- Categorical features: one-hot encoded
- Numerical features: standardized using `StandardScaler`
- Features like `job`, `education`, `month`, and `contact` were encoded
- Outliers removed: rows with negative balance + subscription
- Final dataset included 36+ engineered columns

## ✅ Final Model: Random Forest

- **Best Parameters:** `n_estimators=300`, `max_depth=13`
- **Cross-validated Accuracy:** ~93%
- **Top Features:** `duration`, `poutcome`, `balance`, `contact`, `education`
- Trained with `GridSearchCV` and exported using `joblib`
